# Jun's README

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jun.

## Personally

I was currently live with my family in [Amoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen), which is a small island in China.

I'm an enthusiast of new technologies, always eager to try new things.

## As an employee

I'm now working as an Engineer at [@ringcentral](https://github.com/ringcentral). My daily work is working with excellent colleagues from the Integration Team to maintaining some of [RingCentral Apps](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/).

Prior working at [@Sumi-Interactive](https://github.com/Sumi-Interactive) and [@pracstrat](https://github.com/pracstrat).

## As an oppen-source enthusiaster

In GitHub, I've many open-source projects, most of which are written with Elixir and Ruby. Ruby truly makes me happy while programming. And I also really enjoy programming with Elixir on a powerful OTP platform.
